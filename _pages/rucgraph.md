<a href="https://github.com/rucdatascience/rucgraph" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">rucgraph</a> is an open-source, easy-to-use library of cpp header files, mainly designed for performing graph computing tasks. It is on Github, and accepts Pull Requests! 


It contains different types of adjacency lists to represent a graph, e.g., "graph_v_of_v_idealID" is a simple adjacency list built using vectors, while "graph_hash_of_mixed_weighted" is a complex adjacency list built using a "dynamic" mixup of vectors and hashes.
